        <h1>Campaigns</h1>
        <div>
            <p>A Google Ads campaign is a set of one or more ad groups (ads, keywords, and bids) that share a budget,
                location targeting, and other settings. Campaigns are typically used to organize categories of products
                or
                services offered by an advertiser.</p>
            <p>Items that can be set at the campaign level include bids, budget, language, location, distribution for
                the
                Google Network, and more. Large advertisers typically create separate ad campaigns to run ads in
                different
                locations or using different budgets.</p>
        </div>
    </section>
    <section class="campaign_types">
        <h2>Campaign types</h2>
        <p>Campaign types are centered around Google's advertising networks: the Google Search Network, the Google
            Display Network, and the YouTube Network.</p>
        <p>These networks make up all the places where your ads can appear, including Google sites, websites that show
            relevant Google ads, and other placements (such as mobile apps).</p>
        <p>You choose a network setting by selecting a campaign type for your campaign. The API supports the following
            campaign types:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Display Network only</li>
            <li>Search Network only</li>
            <li>Display Expansion on Search</li>
            <li>Local campaigns</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            You can use the API to create and manage campaigns optimized for different marketing objectives:
        </p>
        <ul type="disc">
            <li>App campaigns</li>
            <li>Call-only</li>
            <li>Discovery</li>
            <li>Performance Max</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Differences from the Google Ads UI</h3>
        <p>Not all campaign types in the Google Ads UI are supported in the API, such as Video Campaigns. Video campaign
            metrics are available for retrieval in the API. However, video campaigns cannot be mutated at all from the
            API, including simple operations such as pausing or enabling as well as complex operations like organizing,
            changing criteria, or adding ad groups.</p>
        <h4>Campaign subtypes</h4>
        <p>Campaign subtypes in the Google Ads UI, such as Standard and All features, help UI users find relevant
            campaign options, but there is no corresponding attribute in the API's Campaign object.</p>

        <p>This UI column is similar to the AdvertisingChannelType and AdvertisingChannelSubType fields in the API, but
            there is not a one-to-one mapping between these fields and Campaign subtype in the UI.</p>

        <p>For example, a Search-only campaign created using the API will always be an All features campaign from the UI
            perspective.</p>
