            <p>We hold ourselves and each other accountable for demonstrating the Amazon Leadership Principles through
                our actions
                every day. Our Leadership Principles describe how Amazon does business, how leaders lead, and how we
                keep the customer
                at the center of our decisions. Our unique Amazon culture, described by our Leadership Principles, helps
                us relentlessly
                pursue our mission of being Earth’s most customer-centric company, best employer, and safest place to
                work.</p>

                <p class="child">Leaders start with the customer and work backwards. They work vigorously to earn and
                    keep
                    customer trust. Although
                    leaders pay attention to competitors, they obsess over customers.</p>

                <h3 class="child">Ownership</h3>
                <p class="child">Leaders are owners. They think long term and don’t sacrifice long-term value for
                    short-term
                    results. They act on behalf
                    of the entire company, beyond just their own team. They never say “that’s not my job.”</p>

                <h3 class="child">Invent and Simplify</h3>
                <p class="child">Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams and always find
                    ways to simplify. They are
                    externally aware, look for new ideas from everywhere, and are not limited by “not invented here.” As
                    we do new things,
                    we accept that we may be misunderstood for long periods of time.</p>

                <p class="child">Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts. They seek
                    diverse perspectives and work to
                    disconfirm their beliefs.</p>

                <p class="child">Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves. They are curious
                    about new possibilities and act
                    to explore them.</p>

                <h3 class="child">Hire and Develop the Best</h3>
                <p class="child">Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion. They recognize
                    exceptional talent, and willingly move
                    them throughout the organization. Leaders develop leaders and take seriously their role in coaching
                    others. We work on
                    behalf of our people to invent mechanisms for development like Career Choice.</p>

                <h3 class="child">Insist on the Highest Standards</h3>
                <p class="child">Leaders have relentlessly high standards—many people may think these standards are
                    unreasonably high. Leaders are
                    continually raising the bar and drive their teams to deliver high-quality products, services, and
                    processes. Leaders
                    ensure that defects do not get sent down the line and that problems are fixed so they stay fixed.

                <h3 class="child">Think Big</h3>
                <p class="child">Thinking small is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Leaders create and communicate a bold
                    direction that inspires results.
                    They think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers.

                <p class="child">Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need
                    extensive study. We value calculated risk taking.

            <h3 class="child">Earn Trust</h3>
            <p class="child">Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully. They are vocally self-critical, even when
            doing so is awkward or embarrassing. Leaders do not believe their or their team’s body odor smells of perfume. They
            benchmark themselves and their teams against the best.
